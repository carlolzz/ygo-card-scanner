# YGO Scanner

A mobile app for cataloguing a physical Yu-Gi-Oh card collection. The user
points the camera at a card, the app reads the 8-digit passcode printed in
the bottom-left corner, looks it up in a local SQLite database, and logs it
to their collection along with a condition grade. Manual search-and-add is a
permanent first-class alternative to scanning, not a fallback.

## Stack

Use exactly this, do not substitute.

- Flutter (stable channel), Dart 3, null-safe
- sqflite for storage — no ORM, no drift, hand-written DAOs with raw SQL
- riverpod (flutter_riverpod + riverpod_annotation + riverpod_generator) for state management
- go_router for navigation
- freezed + json_serializable for models
- dio for HTTP
- camera + google_mlkit_text_recognition for the scan pipeline
- sqflite_common_ffi for running DAO tests on the host

Generated code (`*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`) is gitignored, not committed.

## Database schema (version 1)

```sql
CREATE TABLE cards (
  passcode      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name          TEXT NOT NULL,
  type          TEXT,
  frame_type    TEXT,
  attribute     TEXT,
  race          TEXT,
  atk           INTEGER,
  def           INTEGER,
  level         INTEGER,
  description   TEXT,
  image_url     TEXT,
  archetype     TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX idx_cards_name ON cards(name);

CREATE TABLE printings (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  passcode      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES cards(passcode) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  set_code      TEXT,
  set_name      TEXT,
  rarity        TEXT,
  UNIQUE(passcode, set_code, rarity)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_printings_passcode ON printings(passcode);

CREATE TABLE collection_entries (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  passcode      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES cards(passcode),
  printing_id   INTEGER REFERENCES printings(id),
  condition     TEXT NOT NULL,
  edition       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'UNLIMITED',
  language      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'EN',
  quantity      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK(quantity > 0),
  notes         TEXT,
  created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(passcode, printing_id, condition, edition, language)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_entries_passcode ON collection_entries(passcode);

CREATE TABLE meta (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
```

Notes:

- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on every connection open, in `onConfigure` —
  never `onOpen`, never inside a transaction.
- Timestamps are epoch milliseconds, integers.
- The UNIQUE constraint on `collection_entries` is load-bearing: adding a
  card that already exists in the same condition/edition/language must
  increment `quantity`, not create a second row. **Subtlety**: SQLite
  treats every `NULL` as distinct under `UNIQUE`, so `printing_id IS NULL`
  rows (very common — manual add without a chosen printing) cannot rely on
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`; `CollectionDao.addOrIncrement`
  branches to a manual find-or-insert for that case. See
  `lib/data/db/dao/collection_dao.dart`.
- `printings.passcode` cascades on delete; `collection_entries.printing_id`
  does not (no `ON DELETE` action) — deleting a printing that still has
  collection entries pointing at it is rejected, by design, so a user's
  logged cards are never silently orphaned.
- Migrations are an ordered map of version -> list of SQL statements in
  `lib/data/db/migrations.dart`, so v2+ can be appended later. `schema_version`
  is mirrored into the `meta` table alongside sqflite's own `user_version`.

## Enum persistence rules

Enums persist by name (SCREAMING_SNAKE via `toDb()`/`fromDb()`), never by
ordinal/index.

`CardCondition` (Cardmarket order, best -> worst, `sortOrder` = declaration
order):

| member | shortCode | label | db value |
|---|---|---|---|
| mint | MT | Mint | MINT |
| nearMint | NM | Near Mint | NEAR_MINT |
| excellent | EX | Excellent | EXCELLENT |
| good | GD | Good | GOOD |
| lightPlayed | LP | Light Played | LIGHT_PLAYED |
| played | PL | Played | PLAYED |
| poor | PO | Poor | POOR |

`CardEdition`:

| member | label | db value |
|---|---|---|
| first | 1st Edition | FIRST |
| unlimited | Unlimited | UNLIMITED |
| limited | Limited Edition | LIMITED |

## Build order

1. **Data layer + models + DAO tests** ← done
2. **Design tokens, theme, home menu shell** ← done (home menu is a fixed non-scrolling 2x2 `Row`/`Column` grid, not `GridView` — a scrollable grid pushed two tiles off-screen on short viewports; see `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart`. Routing via `go_router` — `lib/core/router.dart`/`routes.dart`. Unbuilt destinations render `shared/widgets/coming_soon_screen.dart`.)
3. Collection screen against seeded fake data (list, filters, detail view, quantity editing) ← next
4. Manual add-card flow (search by name → pick printing → pick condition → save)
5. YGOPRODeck sync with progress UI, run on first launch
6. `tools/build_hash_index.py` — download all card art, compute pHashes, emit `assets/card_hashes.json`
7. Camera + ML Kit passcode OCR, continuous-scan state machine
8. pHash art-matching fallback for OCR misses
9. Settings (default condition, default edition, language, re-sync, theme)
10. Export to CSV and .ydk; collection statistics

## Standing rules

- No ORM. Raw SQL in DAOs only. No SQL outside `lib/data/db/`.
- Widgets never touch DAOs — screens depend on repositories via Riverpod providers.
- Every DAO method gets a test before the feature that consumes it.
- Enums persist by name, never by index.
- No business logic in `build()` methods.
- Prefer adding a migration over editing an existing one once version 1 is committed.

## Design direction (later sessions)

Dark-first, high-contrast, minimal. A single accent color, generous
spacing, large tap targets — this app is used one-handed while holding a
stack of cards in the other hand. Card condition renders as compact colored
chips using the MT/NM/EX short codes. The home menu is four large tiles:
Log Cards, My Collection, Statistics, Settings. These decisions live in
`lib/core/theme/tokens.dart` as named constants, not scattered magic numbers.
